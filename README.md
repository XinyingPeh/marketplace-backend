## Overview

This project is a full-stack e-commerce website built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The primary focus of this project is to create a robust and feature-rich e-commerce platform that allows users to browse, buy, and sell products in a seamless and secure manner.

## Technologies Used

### Backend Technologies:

- **Node.js**: The project utilizes Node.js as the server-side runtime environment, allowing for efficient handling of backend logic and APIs.

- **Express**: Express is used as the web application framework to manage routes, middleware, and HTTP requests for the backend.

- **MongoDB Atlas**: The project integrates MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based database service, to store and manage product data, user information, and other relevant data.

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: JWT is used for secure user authentication, ensuring that user sessions are validated and authorized.

- **bcrypt**: The project implements bcrypt for secure password hashing, providing an extra layer of security for user authentication.

- **Joi**: Joi is used for data validation, ensuring that input data adheres to specified constraints and rules.

### Payment Integration:

- **Stripe**: The project securely integrates Stripe as the payment platform, allowing users to make payments using various methods, including credit cards and digital wallets.

### Deployment and Hosting:

- **render.com**: The backend is deployed and hosted on render.com, providing a scalable and reliable hosting solution.

### Development and Testing:

- **Postman**: Postman is used for API testing and development, ensuring that endpoints are functional and accurate.

## Features

The marketplace-backend project offers the following features:

1. **User Authentication**: The backend includes a robust and secure user authentication system. Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts. Passwords are securely hashed and stored to protect user data.

2. **Product Listing**: Sellers can add products to the platform with detailed information, including product images, descriptions, and pricing. This feature enables a wide range of products to be available for buyers to browse and purchase.

3. **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart, review their selected items, and proceed to checkout with ease. The shopping cart ensures a smooth purchasing process for buyers.

4. **Secure Payment Integration**: The backend securely integrates with Stripe's API to handle payment processing. This ensures smooth and secure transactions for buyers and sellers.

5. **Error Handling and Logging**: The backend implements robust error handling mechanisms and logging to track and address any issues that may occur during operation.

6. **Validation of Data Input**: Data input from users is thoroughly validated using Joi, ensuring that all information entered adheres to specified rules and formats.
